            "hello everyone and today we're going to",
            "introduce the open a reasoning model and",
            "and also we will see that how we can use",
            "that one in data analysis and also",
            "compare the performance against the",
            "traditional GPT model so reasoning model",
            "has been a very hot topic recently uh",
            "opena and also deeps all have their own",
            "reasoning models uh so generally",
            "speaking for open AIS reasoning model so",
            "the model will take multiple steps s to",
            "process the prompt before the generating",
            "uh responses so they all take multiple",
            "iterations and during those uh thinking",
            "process they are going to compare the",
            "different solutions and hopefully they",
            "are going to give us the best or better",
            "solution so that's better than the the",
            "traditional GPT models and also the",
            "model is using what they called the",
            "reasoning tokens to help some model to",
            "uh find the bad uh the better solution",
            "so for example in uh when the model",
            "receive a prompt so it will take the",
            "input they will also generate resoning",
            "tokens to help compare or identify",
            "different solutions and they may have an",
            "initial output and then they will go to",
            "the",
            "second iteration and also go to third",
            "iteration uh until they reach the",
            "limitation of the t uh contact window",
            "and then",
            "uh um response so in their response they",
            "will report the output uh keep in mind",
            "that the reasoning tokens will not be",
            "reported uh this is different from the",
            "the deeps R1 model so uh if I using deep",
            "sync and you all see the the reasoning",
            "process however uh if you are using the",
            "open a 01 model o1 reasoning model we",
            "will not be able to see the the",
            "reasoning process",
            "uh so the key difference between",
            "reasoning model and of GPT so for",
            "reasoning model it is a multip reasoning",
            "uh approach so it will evaluates",
            "different solutions before they",
            "reporting the best uh response uh it is",
            "optimized for complicated like data",
            "analysis coding um and also uh planning",
            "uh and also it also has great",
            "capabilities in uh un understanding data",
            "visualization so if have charts and the",
            "reasing model is doing better than the",
            "GPT",
            "models uh the rasing model has a new",
            "parameter C called a reasoning effect so",
            "it controls that to what level that uh",
            "to adjust the depths of the reasoning so",
            "it has low median and also high so three",
            "options and also if you choose High it",
            "will take longer and also it of course",
            "it will it will cost more reasoning",
            "tokens so let's start",
            "uh so first you need",
            "buy uh open air API uh so from open air",
            "website and then uh we recommend that",
            "you you start API in the in the secret",
            "place in the safe place so uh in our",
            "case we are using the AWS Secrets",
            "manager because we are using the AWS s",
            "maker uh to to hold this",
            "notebook and if you haven't already done",
            "that so you also need to uh P install",
            "the pon Library uh the one that we need",
            "to install on the on this instance is",
            "called openi so let's just go ahead",
            "install that Pon",
            "Library uh so open Library will allow us",
            "to call 01 models and also the the GPT",
            "models uh in addition to openi we also",
            "need the uh the following uh libraries",
            "like bot three uh to cause AWS uh secet",
            "manager we also need trans some data",
            "into Json so we need Json uh Pon Library",
            "we also need ion display and penders and",
            "pprint all right uh so let's import",
            "those Pon",
            "Library um and the next we're going to",
            "retriever our API so I already uh",
            "started my open a API uh on my AWS",
            "seqence manager so uh this is where I",
            "need to call this ad last secret manager",
            "function to get my API ke so I just call",
            "this fun so I just Define this",
            "function and next uh so I will call this",
            "function to retriever my API K and then",
            "I'm going to pass that one to this OPI",
            "uh",
            "client okay uh next So today we're going",
            "to try and use the reasoning model to do",
            "two tasks uh the number one is to to uh",
            "understand or to to analyze a data so",
            "the data set we used is called the",
            "diamonds uh data set so it's diamonds.",
            "CSV file so it's not a big data set um",
            "you can find this data set on my GitHub",
            "um the data contains uh some attributes",
            "about uh some diamonds like their weight",
            "color uh Clarity and also price so let's",
            "go ahead import load this data so so",
            "again you can find this diamonds since",
            "we found from my uh",
            "GitHub so it has weight color Clarity uh",
            "it also has several readers so the price",
            "are uh provided evaluated by those uh",
            "readers so one thing that is um very",
            "interesting is that so diam",
            "has have a clarity called if so if uh is",
            "the highest level of the clarity of the",
            "diamond and normally it should be the",
            "most expensive",
            "diamond and however uh in our data set",
            "if you calculate the average price per",
            "Clarity uh surprisingly you are find",
            "that the diamonds with the with the if",
            "Clarity tend to be the least expensive",
            "so that's very interesting and if you",
            "use like uh some bi tools like Tableau",
            "uh to explore the data uh with human",
            "being uh you will be able to see that",
            "the reason is because that in in the in",
            "this data set the diamonds with RF",
            "clarities are actually smaller okay so",
            "it's smaller so that's why they have the",
            "lower uh average price okay so that's a",
            "DAT seter that we have and now we are",
            "going to see that if the reasoning model",
            "is able to find this pattern and also is",
            "able to give us a a reasonable",
            "explanation uh so here we are going to",
            "write this prompt so we we tells the",
            "model that to analyze the provided data",
            "and determine that y diamonds with RF",
            "Clarity uh have the lowest price with we",
            "also want the model to provide some Pon",
            "code so that the code can generate",
            "charts to support their",
            "analysis and in the prompt we also pass",
            "the data so in the Json format so we can",
            "see that we loaded data into penders we",
            "pass the data into this uh Json",
            "format okay so let's define this um",
            "prompt all right uh so first we are try",
            "with we will start with a GPT model so",
            "with def find a GPT help function it we",
            "receive the user prompt uh we are",
            "provide the prompt as a user message and",
            "here we're using the GPT 40 so that's uh",
            "uh the most powerful GPT model as of",
            "today um we also we have set the",
            "temperature to be zero um we also want",
            "to say the the token usage so we are see",
            "that how many tokens been used uh let's",
            "define that function so so now we're",
            "going to uh get the result from this uh",
            "GPT",
            "model okay so let's see uh whether or",
            "not the GPT model is able to to answer",
            "the questions so why the RF diamonds are",
            "cheaper okay uh so first we can see that",
            "um the total",
            "token 11,000 so the prompt token and you",
            "can see that there is no reasoning token",
            "toen because GPT GPT model is not a",
            "reasoning model so it didn't use any uh",
            "uh reasoning tokens and next we're going",
            "to display the result uh because for GPT",
            "models the results uh are in markdown",
            "syntax so we are using this display uh",
            "markdown function to show the the",
            "output okay uh so you can see this is",
            "the output uh from GPT models so to",
            "analyze if why they have the lowest uh",
            "average price we need to exam the data",
            "set and consider different uh factors",
            "such as weight rating so it suggest that",
            "start loading data",
            "Independence and now they doing to F out",
            "the data based on the",
            "clarity and they will calculate average",
            "price uh for the if",
            "Clarity uh there are we also need to",
            "calculate a PR for the all other uh",
            "clarities I guess they're going to make",
            "some",
            "comparisions uh so they also create some",
            "uh charts average price by",
            "Clarity uh distribution of the weight",
            "for RF",
            "Clarity uh distribution of the colors",
            "for RF",
            "Clarity and also do those following",
            "analysis so it will create bar chart",
            "hisr uh the count plot for colors the",
            "count plant for",
            "rers and it has those uh conclusions so",
            "the weight uh so if the are lighter then",
            "it could explain the lower price uh",
            "since weight sign impact Diamond pricing",
            "so and not color and Al reader",
            "so so based on this uh output is more",
            "like some uh suggestions so they just",
            "gave us Pon code that okay so uh if you",
            "run those code and you uh then human can",
            "read the charts and also May able to",
            "understand why if diamonds are cheaper",
            "so let's run those code uh let's see if",
            "we how the uh dat look like so I'm going",
            "to",
            "copy the gener rated pass on code so",
            "start a new",
            "cell and paste",
            "uh so uh I'm going to remove those part",
            "because we already have the data that",
            "been",
            "loaded okay and now if we run this piece",
            "of python",
            "code and uh so we should be able to see",
            "those visualizations uh however we can",
            "tell that uh GPT model didn't answer the",
            "question they just provided some",
            "uh possible solutions to investigate",
            "this uh problem but it didn't give us a",
            "real answer for our question so let's",
            "look so they they they did great uh gave",
            "us some nice chart by providing the pant",
            "code like every prise by Clarity we can",
            "say RF indeed is lower than the other",
            "clarities they also give us a",
            "distribution of the if uh with",
            "distribution of the diamonds which to me",
            "does not make any sense because if you",
            "only see the if uh well it may make a",
            "little bit sense because we can see most",
            "of diamonds are are uh smaller so that's",
            "actually the reason but GPT model",
            "didn't um spell that out didn't tell me",
            "okay that's exact",
            "reason and color distributions okay so",
            "we can see uh for RF so so we can see",
            "that the colors",
            "um and also readers uh again this just",
            "give us some",
            "possible uh Solutions but it didn't give",
            "us a conclusion in our uh toour question",
            "all right uh so now we are going to move",
            "ahead with our reasoning model so uh we",
            "similarly we're going to define a help",
            "function so with a o series model or",
            "reasoning model",
            "uh in this model as we mentioned earlier",
            "so it has reasoning effect so you can",
            "you can control the the reasoning depths",
            "uh so we're going to use",
            "high uh in reasoning model the",
            "temperature parameter is no longer",
            "supported so you cannot change the",
            "temperature and also in reasoning model",
            "uh the system message is now replaced by",
            "the developer message so if you want",
            "provide some instruction to the to the",
            "model like uh as a system message you",
            "should call it a",
            "developer and here are some best",
            "practice uh uh for o models and those",
            "are from OPI uh reasoning models best",
            "practice",
            "guide so for example we need keep the",
            "prompt simple and direct and also and",
            "this is different from GPT model so for",
            "the reasoning model we should avoid the",
            "chain of the SCE prompts because om mod",
            "already did that one internally so we no",
            "longer need to provide those",
            "instructions so that's a huge difference",
            "between GPT model so in GPT model we",
            "mentioned that we should want to provide",
            "some chain of the thoughts to give more",
            "uh direct or clear instructions for the",
            "jpt model but for o1 uh we should avoid",
            "Ching of the source",
            "property we still need to use delimit",
            "eliminators like markdowns uh XML tag",
            "Etc uh and also we should try some zero",
            "shots first and if necessary we can give",
            "some some",
            "examples um and also keep in mind that",
            "the markdown syntax is disabled by",
            "default so that's also difference",
            "between uh o1 and the GPT between jpt",
            "model and o1 in jpt model the default",
            "output format is markdown syn tag is",
            "marked down however uh in o1 it is",
            "disabled so we'll see that",
            "later all right uh so this is uh the",
            "function so you can see here uh we're",
            "using o1 uh for the reasoning effect",
            "we're using High uh we no longer need to",
            "provide",
            "temperature um and also we still also",
            "want to report the token so let's define",
            "this",
            "function uh for the prompt we're going",
            "to use",
            "the same prompt so the prompt that we",
            "defined earlier so let's look at the",
            "prompt so the prompt is that analyze the",
            "provide data and also explain that why",
            "if diamonds have the lowest uh average",
            "price uh provide Pon gener chart to",
            "support your conclusion we also provided",
            "the data in the Json",
            "document and now let's try this o",
            "model and hopefully o1 we a we'll be",
            "able to answer our questions uh we will",
            "also see that how many tokens are used",
            "uh in O model um especially the",
            "reasoning",
            "tokens okay so it definitely take longer",
            "than the GPT model uh we can see that",
            "the The Prompt token is almost a same",
            "however we spend more tokens in the",
            "reasoning process so here you can see",
            "the reason token is uh",
            "2,000 uh so definitely it's uh o model",
            "is more expensive than than the GPC",
            "models and also",
            "slower okay so let's look at the",
            "output uh so this output so again you",
            "can see that uh the output is no longer",
            "markdown syntax uh so this below the",
            "step bystep P analysis showing that the",
            "main reason the if diamonds with a lower",
            "average price",
            "um okay so uh so it say that Clarity",
            "alone does not dominate the the final",
            "price uh however it has uh the weight so",
            "the price per Carter and also",
            "colors uh have much larger impact on the",
            "total price and it gave us conclusion so",
            "because a lot of those I have diamonds",
            "in a date set happen to be smaller",
            "diamonds and also usually",
            "and3 and their average total price is",
            "much lower okay so that's very nice um",
            "they also provided the the pon code so",

            "the the Diamond set is only RF so the",
            "calculate the average price per",
            "Clarity and they gave us uh a bar chart",
            "so this bar chart show that if has the",

            "it is the top",
            "Clarity and also why if can be cheaper",
            "so uh to see why look at how many if",
            "diamonds are in the in this dat set are",

            "count uh the diamonds Clarity andal",

            "smaller and also they also give us",

            "Clarity and this chart shows that I",
            "diamonds tend to be smaller on average",

            "they have this conclusion so the DAT set",

            "diamonds like with VSS or",

            "weight okay uh so that kind make sense",
            "so can explain that why RF are cheaper",

            "so we can say that the result is uh",
            "accurate so the major problem is that",
            "the y- axis is essentially upside down",
            "with zero at the top and larger value at",

            "prompt uh it's updating so looks like",
            "the end stand okay uh let's see neutral",
            "so the average",
            "uh the value",
            "is oh they are using the average of the",

            "count",
            "negative uh and also the",
            "positive okay uh so let's look at this",
            "uh aggregation",
            "pipeline okay uh uh to be honest",
            "uh uh I think I I cannot understand this",
            "uh aggression pipeline um uh so what I",
            "did was that I just copy this prompt in",
            "campus Because I trust the natural",
            "language query um better than the",
            "natural language chart um and I got this",
            "result and so that for the positive",

            "0.4 so I think this is probably the",

            "so let's see so that's using a group and",
            "US average uh so uh so I don't know why",

            "time uh it's",

            "and uh still super complicated but uh",
            "but at least the number looks fine to me",

            "um uh fil data so I can do that uh so I",

            "by AI we still have the option that to",

            "natural language charts is a great",

            "some uh improvements so it's not that",
            "work that good as natural language query",
            "okay so one last thing that I didn't",
            "know in my previous tutorial is",
            "that uh they have the fil function where",
            "you can do interactive filters just like",
            "uh Tableau or quick side so for example",
            "here I open the",
            "filter and then you can add filters so",
            "for example I can add uh",
            "sentimental uh as a filter uh I can also",
            "add you user location as a second filter",
            "okay um and once you have that one as",
            "filter so of course one thing you can do",
            "is that you can just let's see I just",
            "want to look at the",
            "positive uh results so if I apply the",
            "filters uh you can see that uh all the",
            "results are updated so",
            "um I only have 300 tweets that are",
            "positive that's not true",
            "okay anyway",
            "um so so that you can filter the the",
            "values based on um on this filter all",
            "another nice thing is that um you can",

            "charts make sure that uh the variables",
            "that you filter is in this uh filter bar",

            "okay um and also uh I also draged",
            "locations to the filters so here for",
            "example uh if",
            "I there's no disect okay I'm going to",
            "select all um so because location is not",
            "also a part of the filter so you can uh",

            "if I select",
            "everything and now we show everything",
            "that uh back to normal all right uh so",
            "finally if you want to share this charts",
            "you can just go ahead",
            "share and you can make it public uh just",
            "pay attention that if you want make your",
            "dashboard to be public you have to make",
            "your Twitter the data to be public as",
            "well so if you click manage and you",
            "check a public your data like allow on",

            "um and now this URL will be public so I",

            "here uh I'm testing this one in um",
            "Chrome so in the private mode uh so now",
            "you can see that uh if we can see other",
            "visualizations then uh your chart is now",
            "uh being public uh so you can also test",

            "okay so probably print the maximum item",

            "so first we have this list so now I just",
            "continue hit enter so the maximum item",

            "we see if I is greater than maximal and",

            "all right uh it's nice but I think they",

            "hello everyone so today we're going to",
            "learn um what is reinforcement learning",
            "and as to be more excited uh we're going",
            "to try the the reinforcement models on",
            "the car that can really Drive in the",
            "real world uh so the car is called AWS",
            "deeper uh you can buy one from Amazon so",
            "uh to be honest it's not that cheap",
            "um uh there are two types of cars uh we",
            "have the basic car which has only one",
            "camera",
            "or we have another car that has a",
            "lighter sensor so it can detect the the",
            "object calculate distance and it has two",
            "cameras so with more uh sensors the car",
            "will get more information and uh should",
            "be able to to drive better and once you",
            "have the car you can follow their uh",
            "getting started tutorial on AWS website",
            "uh where they provided very detailed uh",
            "video tutorials like uh how to assemble",
            "the deeper uh it's not that hard how",
            "collaborator your deep rer you can also",
            "build your own track uh um because uh in",
            "most cases a car only works on the uh on",
            "the track that has a very dark uh dark",
            "trackers and also you also need the",
            "white tapes to tell the car where are",
            "the boundaries of the roads of the track",
            "all the track um and then you can build",
            "your models and you can deploy the model",
            "to the C so the car can drive by itself",
            "uh if you are interested you can join",
            "the other AWS deer communities where",
            "probably you can start a reacing that",
            "either uh in the internet or uh in real",
            "world okay so once you have the car or",
            "or without the car so actually if you",
            "don't have car you can still try to",
            "learn uh reinforcement uh learning that",
            "on deep resarch so so whether or not you",
            "have a car uh so you can go to a console",
            "and you can just search deeper and and",
            "it will bring you to this uh page and uh",
            "if you go on left you can see that where",
            "you have your your resarch profiles",
            "which you can add it to your details uh",
            "so I just change the name like student",
            "one",
            "demo and uh they have the getting",
            "started page which I highly recommend",
            "that",
            "uh uh just look at this uh getting",
            "started course uh it's not very long to",
            "talking about um reinforcement learning",
            "uh so basically there are three types of",
            "the machine learning models so we have",
            "supervised learning uh we have",
            "unsupervised learning and we have",
            "reinforcement learning so in",
            "reinforcement learning we don't provide",
            "like the the labels Etc instead we have",
            "an agent is in our case is a car so it",
            "will interact with the environment and",
            "the environment in our case is just the",
            "track so the agent will learn learn how",
            "to interact with environment and also",
            "during those interactions so for some",
            "actions we all give some uh scores like",
            "uh rewards so if they're doing a bad job",
            "otherwise they will have zero scores",
            "okay so for example in this case the car",
            "will receive 2.2 because in this",
            "iteration it just the the the total",
            "score is two plus point2 so that's",
            "2.2 and then the car we are try other",
            "iterations and then try to maximize the",
            "score so in the second iteration the the",
            "points will be 2 plus two plus2 so is 2.",
            "4 so the car will",
            "try uh multiple ways and also make sure",
            "that they can reach a high score",
            "eventually",
            "um okay so with more experience the",
            "agent were getting better and better so",
            "that they can reach the uh the final",
            "lines um instead of taking those random",
            "actions okay so that's a very basic",
            "introduction about the reinforce",
            "reinforcement learning",
            "models and then here is something that",
            "you can customize like for example uh",
            "the reward function for example if the",
            "car stay on the track and what are the",
            "rewards that you're going to give um and",
            "also if the car follow the center lines",
            "and also what other reward you're going",
            "to give like the distance uh between",
            "center lines um Etc uh so whether not",
            "you give it a high reward also lower",
            "reward ET uh so for those different type",
            "of the parameters and how are you going",
            "to define those rewards so that's",
            "something that you can uh you can",
            "customize all right uh so let's go ahead",
            "and create our model so uh before",
            "creating a model so before creating",
            "model so you can go to your your garage",
            "uh where uh you can specify what kind of",
            "cards you're going to use again this is",
            "totally uh virtual cards so you can",
            "build as many cards as possible so for",
            "example here you can say I want I have a",
            "card I call it demo",
            "card",
            "and and then you can change the",
            "colors and here you can tell uh is that",
            "has one camera or it has a two camera",
            "okay so that is a stereo camera um which",
            "is better than the a single camera or",
            "whether not you have a lther sensor or",
            "not okay so you can customize your cars",
            "uh first and then you can sit down and",
            "now you can see I have a a c that has uh",
            "a li sense and a stero camera uh I have",
            "a demo card that I just created and this",
            "is the original car which has a single",
            "camera okay so uh so once you you you're",
            "happy with your cars and of course you",
            "have a real car you may want create a a",
            "car that match with your your real car",
            "and now we going to train the models",
            "and so you you have to be careful",
            "because the models are not cheap so it",
            "take about like uh five or $10 for each",
            "model that I have trained um so here",
            "let's see go let's just give a Qui quick",
            "demo so we create a model",
            "and you can give the model name uh so I",
            "call",
            "demo and you can choose the track so if",
            "you know that which track you are going",
            "to race",
            "um you can also view more",
            "tracks okay and those are some track",
            "that use in the real world",
            "computations",
            "okay and next you can choose the RIS",
            "type so for example if you have one",
            "single camera I you can use a time trial",
            "which means that uh uh the car that uh",
            "uh the first C that reach the reach the",
            "goal is a winner or you can try using",
            "this object avoidance that is that is uh",
            "especially if you have a car that has",
            "lighta sensors where you can choose is",
            "that a fixed location or those are",
            "random locations and also number of",
            "objects on the",
            "road and if you have two cards and then",
            "you can use this head tohe reasing so so",
            "that each car will try avoid each other",
            "um and you can also set the uh the speed",
            "uh the number of the cards ET Etc so for",
            "beginners I would recommend you start",
            "from the time trial uh and later uh uh",
            "you can start you can try the other",
            "models again you can try to use in",
            "different algorithm and for different",
            "algorithms they have the different",
            "hyperparameters okay so",
            "um uh here I'm just use the default one",
            "and later when you get more experience",
            "and you can come back here and also",
            "change the hyper parameters okay um and",
            "also uh keep in mind that if you want",
            "more iterations it will cost your more",
            "credits on",
            "ews and depends on the algorithm you",
            "selected you may have the option to",
            "choose different action space uh if",
            "you're interested you can check their",
            "documents uh to see what uh the exact",
            "details and next you're going to choose",
            "a car so I'm going to use my demo",
            "car uh so that essentially they allow",
            "the configuration of this car uh to",
            "train the car in this",
            "model okay so this is the",
            "reward function that we uh talked",
            "earlier so um so this a function that is",
            "uh uh let let the agent to follow the",
            "center line uh you can also try the",
            "other",
            "example uh for example follow the",
            "central",
            "line",
            "uh stay inside of uh stay inside of the",
            "two bers okay and prevent Z zigzag",
            "okay and also object",
            "avoidance",
            "okay and once you you use the function",
            "of of course you can totally customize",
            "your own function if you like uh once",
            "you uh choose a function and you can",
            "also TW those parameters so for example",
            "uh if the car likely to crash or close",
            "off the track so what is the reward like",
            "you can give it to zero if you like um",
            "uh and also if the uh if this is follow",
            "uh the keep close to the central line so",
            "what is the reward Etc and then you may",
            "want to validate your",
            "code okay and if that passed uh you can",
            "also set the uh the stop conditions uh",
            "so the maximum time so uh the maximum",
            "time must between five and also uh 1,440",
            "minutes again if you train the model",
            "longer the model will perform better uh",
            "if you train the model shorter the uh uh",
            "the model may not it will save your",
            "credits so if you TR shorter um it will",
            "save your credits okay and and also do",
            "you want submit this one to eras uh you",
            "can check no okay uh if you check no and",
            "you don't need to uh to accept this",
            "terms okay so now I'm going ahead and",
            "create the",
            "model okay",
            "uh so now the model is now uh being",
            "loaded so okay is now uh initialized",
            "it's being initialized so after a few",
            "minutes uh you will be able to see that",
            "uh how the mod is",
            "training",
            "okay okay uh so this is now when your",
            "model is",
            "being in a training session so you can",
            "see that uh the car is",
            "now uh moving and off the road",
            "okay and come back and moving and off",
            "the road and and later uh after it chain",
            "for like a few iterations and you will",
            "be able to see the scores uh and also",
            "the uh uh here so on the chart so after",
            "a few iterations and hopefully uh you",
            "will be able to see that the scores will",
            "go up uh so like",
            "this okay uh so you can see at uh at",
            "take like 1 hour so that's a initial",
            "time that we set up earlier uh you can",
            "also stop the training if you like um",
            "again the longer uh the model will",
            "perform better however it will also cost",
            "uh more credits okay uh so I'm going to",
            "stop this training",
            "um uh because I uh don't want waste my",
            "credits and instead I'm going to show",
            "you the other models I already trained",
            "so it will take like 1 hour to to be to",
            "be complete so I have two more models so",
            "I have this 3D test which means that I",
            "used a car that has a lighter sensor and",
            "also two stereo cameras I also used uh",
            "this uh test for like just use their",
            "base model so uh this it also use a base",
            "uh type of the car so it has only one",
            "camera so let me show you how it look",
            "like so uh you cannot you can see the",
            "the SC so you can see after uh several",
            "iterations and uh you can see the",
            "percentage of the competition so finally",
            "the the car is able to reach the Target",
            "and also the reward so it reached reward",
            "so uh so the reward also",
            "increase",
            "um and once you have complete the",
            "training uh you're able to evaluate your",
            "CS so uh for example once you have the",
            "model you can start a new uh evaluation",
            "which basically is more like you're",
            "doing the uh test performance with your",
            "testing data so uh you can even rewatch",
            "your evaluation video so that's how the",
            "car is doing in the evaluation sensor",
            "the session so that's the first round",
            "um and that's the second",
            "test and that is SE test so you can see",
            "how your how your car work is doing and",
            "you can see the typ so to complete this",
            "uh uh this test it use uh almost 28 uh",
            "seconds okay so so now you have the",
            "model uh once you have the model uh you",
            "can download your model so here you can",
            "copy it to S3 or you can just download",
            "model locally and then you can deploy",
            "your model to your cars so you need to",
            "connect uh uh your car with your",
            "computer which I will show you",
            "later and next you can do a race so for",
            "example if you deploy your card your",
            "model to two cards you can let the",
            "carard run in the physical world or you",
            "can create a res that uh that let your",
            "model to compete virtually so for",
            "example you can go to community",
            "race and here you can create two types",
            "of the race you can do the community",
            "race which that all the AWS users uh",
            "they can participate uh so you have",
            "more uh TR uh trackers that you can",
            "select or you can organize a student",
            "committee Race So if you are doing this",
            "uh students they have to apply uh AWS",
            "deep resource student account and then",
            "they can use that account that uh that",
            "account to train their models um and",
            "also uh to join the RIS by using that",
            "account so that will save a lot of",
            "credits uh however you can see uh uh the",
            "there are a fewer options here so for",
            "example",
            "um they can only risk in this classic",
            "risk format um and Al only one type of",
            "risk at the time tril and also they have",
            "fewer uh risk recers okay so uh trackers",
            "so here I'm going to go ahead and create",
            "a",
            "race uh so I'm going to do a classic",
            "race and also I'm going to do a Time TR",
            "uh you can define a race so I'm going to",
            "say the demo race test and you can tell",
            "when it will start so I see uh it will",
            "start today uh at",
            "uh in 1 minute and it will end",
            "tomorrow",
            "okay and you can choose uh The Trackers",
            "and also",
            "directions okay and submit",
            "okay uh and now this is a URL that you",
            "can copy and you can share with other",
            "users other user withs console a account",
            "they can just open this URL okay",
            "so uh so here I'm going I just switch a",
            "different user",
            "account uh where you can see this is",
            "user that is student demo to and the",
            "user also has a model that trained so uh",
            "with again with a base model so if you",
            "look at the",
            "the evaluation result it is slower than",

            "speed okay so theoretically with small",
            "sensors the car should work drive better",

            "vehicle okay uh so I just Rec",
            "collaborated uh so now you can see the",
            "car is now be able to",

            "very expensive",
            "model uh so I'll use this one okay",
            "you need",
            "to convince",
            "uh this old is years old is a boy or",

            "play with me okay let me see old okay",
            "and see how can I convince so I ask AI",
            "for help uh I use uh very expensive one",
            "so I think this is probably the most",

            "output all right let's also try an image",

            "picture of",
            "playing uh so the only two options I",

            "uh this old is a boy a",

            "at the selected place with uh",

            "the uh first model so it choose like",
            "National Air and Space Museum National",
            "zoom and also children science center",
            "all right um and this uh and also in the",

            "more safe so I think this one I should",

            "single family",
            "house okay which type house is more",
            "expensive all right and uh lastly I'm",

            "house built in recent years",
            "Mall",
            "expensive okay",
            "uh and now let's see how the AI will",
            "work okay and here the response uh to to",
            "determine if most recent build house are",
            "more expensive so it will group The by",
            "the year that house been built okay",
            "and okay so those are just a bunch of",
            "the result uh",
            "statistics",
            "uh and let's see what is conclusions",
            "okay from this data it does seem that",
            "General Trend that more recent build",
            "house tend to be more expensive however",
            "they are quite bit of variance uh so the",
            "very high average is from h building uh",
            "1980s which I I think this is true",
            "because I do have some outliers that",
            "those are super expensive houses that",
            "are uh very expensive that are built uh",
            "in like 200 years",
            "ago all right so uh to me I think the",
            "the logic is very nice so they did",
            "provide very reasonable steps to analyze",
            "the data so uh unfortunately uh the",
            "results are not accurate so well I was",
            "waiting for the AI response so I did a",
            "manual calculation uh so I use Tableau",
            "so I use bi to compare the result",
            "against AI so uh in my data set I have",
            "uh 600 over 600 records of the house",
            "price so you can see here I filed out",
            "Land Lo I filed out the nor values for",
            "the house",
            "types I also filed out no values in the",
            "in the price uh if uh for the in the",
            "price columns so just as uh what as AI",
            "said so remove the price where it's no",
            "no values and those how price that is",
            "not is the Land Lo uh I'm not sure what",
            "nonresident type mean and then I did",
            "calculations so uh uh the AI set there",
            "are uh 300 record and also the average",
            "price is",
            "27 uh",
            "74,000 however so in the real dat set it",
            "has 600 records and our average is",
            "67,000 and for the second question so",
            "which type of house is is more expensive",
            "so the conclusion is right so the uh",
            "based on this one single f is more",
            "expensive however uh and also the logic",
            "is also right so they calculate the",
            "average price for different house types",
            "however uh the numbers are also not",
            "accurate so uh if you look at the",
            "average price per house type so we can",
            "see for condo so we have",
            "117 for the single family we have five",
            "four so we have 500 single family home",
            "um and here it said it has only 100 so",
            "uh so the numbers are not does not match",
            "and my uh assumption is that so uh it is",
            "a very big data set so",
            "um uh however the uh because of the",
            "limitation of the uh the data that we",

            "that's why they have the",
            "inaccurate uh numbers however I I think",
            "the the logic is really makes sense so",
            "uh I'm just curious which model they use",
            "or they use this one okay so that's very",
            "nice um",
            "so yeah I think the logic makes sense is",
            "pretty accurate it's just I believe it's",

            "hating just because we have too many",

            "values uh so let's check the",

            "um uh 1,800 so that's like 200 years ago",
            "so that is an",
            "outlier uh we also do not use MLS ID so",
            "let's also drop that",
            "one and for the ZIP code",
            "um uh we can see majority of",
            "the",
            "um of the uh of zip code are in of the",
            "of the wrers are in one ZIP code so that",

            "is important",
            "in because locations are important uh so",
            "let's um I'm going to drop this one",
            "because I don't think it will be help",
            "because majority of the code like almost",
            "90% of the record are in the same Z code",
            "so it will not help to predict the house",
            "price uh same thing uh andal flaws and",
            "also roof so well of course they are",
            "important but they don't have we don't",
            "have uh we have a lot of missing values",
            "so I'm going to drop the",
            "flaws and",
            "roof uh and also",
            "um architecture uh a lot mixing values",
            "so",
            "drop that",
            "one uh and also the other uh field that",

            "views we are important but we don't have",
            "the the",
            "data",
            "um yes I S the views rooms n of the",
            "rooms again we",
            "have um too much missing values",
            "18 uh they also have other so let's jump",
            "that okay Street well of course location",
            "is significantly important probably the",
            "most important one uh however uh uh it",
            "will be make more sense if we like like",
            "with the distance to the CDC or uh which",
            "school district we are located so if you",
            "just look at the the",
            "strings I don't think they can help and",
            "also we can see the majority of the like",
            "90% 80% almost 80% of the values are",
            "other so so I don't think it it will",
            "help so I'm going drop",
            "St um in the prediction as well",
            "and lastly I'm going to drop the",
            "hting okay so so this step we just",
            "dropped the columns that either we think",
            "they are they're not going to contribute",
            "to our predictions like the uh the MLS",
            "IDs uh all we have a lot of missing",
            "value like heatings so um so now we done",
            "with this step uh let's",
            "add that one okay so now we just dropped",
            "a bunch of the columns that we think",
            "will not uh contribute in our um",
            "prediction okay next we see we still",
            "have a uh some missing values so like",
            "the bedrooms we have some missing values",
            "so the the yellow bar here indicate",
            "missing values um and also I believe uh",
            "like lot sides we also have missing",
            "values so let's also",
            "um see can we hand out the missing",
            "values so hand out missing values so",
            "let's say we're going to uh you can",
            "input which means that you're going to",
            "predict the values for those missing",
            "values or you are going to add indicator",
            "for missing values U I think the the",
            "simplest way is the easiest way is I",
            "just drop all missing values so I'm",
            "going to select all the columns so if",
            "the column has a missing",
            "value or if uh has a row that has a",
            "missing value I'm going to drop that row",
            "so let's go ahead add",
            "that okay so now we we can see we don't",
            "have any uh missing",
            "values uh next",
            "uh so I'm not sure whether or not you",
            "notice that if you look at the lot size",
            "you can see we this dat is uh pretty",
            "weird because we have lot of the values",
            "that is less than 10 like 3",
            "4.7 and we also have some values that is",
            "above like 1,000 like",
            "8,700 okay and those are belong to lot",
            "size so I",
            "guess actually I'm pretty much sure this",
            "error because some people they typed",
            "acres in the lot size and some people",
            "they typed uh square foot uh in the lot",
            "size uh so this also is the error that",

            "handle that one so this one actually is",
            "a is a little bit hard to handle so you",
            "can use uh the customer uh",
            "Transformer uh where you can use uh",
            "python",
            "code uh to handle those errors um so I'm",
            "going to call this one clean L",
            "size okay so I'm going to use uh a",

            "I'm looking at a data frame where lot",

            "the value existing value times this",
            "number so this is a number that one acre",
            "equals uh how many square foot that's",
            "this number so let's",
            "preview and uh let's look check the the",
            "DAT set so that is a l size so now it",
            "looks like make more sense so and let's",
            "add",
            "this uh step okay so that cleaning the",
            "lot size I wish uh in the future canvas",
            "can have some easier way to to clean",
            "those clean uh clean the errors like",

            "um let's just try it so let's see we're",

            "house",
            "price and the first step that you're",
            "going to uh choose your data set so we",

            "going to use the",
            "price uh because we selected price so it",

            "options uh so hopefully in the future",
            "they can provide more uh um um",
            "options and all you can choose uh Act",
            "all multi-layer perception so that is a",

            "um if you choose attri boost and you",

            "okay um to save our time we are going to",
            "use",
            "Auto uh and we will leave everything as",

            "beneath uh the model type uh you can see",

            "uh and also you can also add additional",

            "um I can also do those correlation",

            "build uh you can also choose the",

            "two to four hours so I'm going to use",
            "Quick Build to save the",

            "straightforward and it's very simple and",
            "all you need to do is that just use aut",

            "how many candidates you want all like",

            "hours and then we just wait the model to",
            "be",
            "trained all right and so now our model",
            "is ready uh you can see",
            "the uh the most important",
            "uh feature that in the model prediction",
            "is area the side of house followed by",
            "the year that house been built the lot",
            "size and surprisingly security system is",
            "also uh another important feature so if",
            "you have uh your the price will much",
            "higher uh uh than if you don't have and",
            "and also like uh",
            "fireplace",
            "Al",
            "um okay and our type so we can see the",
            "single time home and they have rather",
            "High uh house price then the townhouse",
            "then",
            "condo all right uh so those are the",
            "impact",
            "and uh if we check the uh the score so",
            "that you can see those are the",
            "predicted versus uh the real values so",
            "we can see we have one",
            "outliner uh uh that we give very high",
            "price than actual value and we also have",
            "a house",
            "that uh is very expensive but we give a",
            "very low value so those are the two",
            "outliers um uh if you're interested you",
            "can check those uh uh data point but for",
            "the majority of the uh of the data I",
            "think it's it's okay uh and also you can",
            "check the advanced uh wow the R square",
            "is extremely low so um",
            "in this",
            "prediction um and also the errors errors",
            "is uh normally distributed so that's",
            "fine however our R square is very low so",
            "uh and also actually our RS rmsc is very",
            "very",
            "high okay so as well is so the",
            "um let's see let's try to make a",
            "prediction",
            "[Music]",
            "so uh so there's several ways I think to",
            "increase uh the r squares so number one",
            "is that of course if you use uh uh if",
            "you train the models longer um probably",
            "you have a better uh performance um we",
            "just use a quick training so and if you",
            "train like from several hours and I'll",
            "try different options so probably your",
            "model will be better uh and also uh if",
            "you reduce outliers like in the in the",
            "price uh probably uh you",
            "uh it will be better uh so you can try",
            "different option or you can try to",
            "remove some features or bring some",
            "feature",
            "back all right let's just use this",
            "prediction and to predict uh a value so",
            "you can make a single prediction I don't",
            "know why ID is here so but I think when",
            "we um train the models we excluded ID um",
